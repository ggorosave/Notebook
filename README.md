## Description
Many people use sticky notes or a notebook to help them remember something they learned, a task to complete later, or even little phrases of encouragement. Notebook is a full-stack note taking application that allows the user to write notes and save them online. The data is persistent so the user can access it from any device. This project utilizes HTML, CSS, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), and [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid). It is deployed via [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps).
